READ ME:

This case makes use of a new set of directories that DIFFER from the December versions.
All of the files you need to play the game are here.

You should *NOT* try to print these documents out -- they are far too big and are not formatted for printing
(if you want a version of the storybook formatted for double sided two-column printing let me know).

The ONLY document you should print out is "High & Low - Case Log.pdf" for recording your progress, and possibly the Research Guide which has a quick list of useful reference locations.

NOTE:

There are now TWO version of the storybook to choose from, an OlderClassic version, and a NewerMarker version.
 * OlderClassic: It is up to you to figure out when you have found everything for the current day; you then go to a briefing where you may learn you missed stuff.
 * NewerClock: You will mark when events happen and be told when you can advance past the current day when certain markers are encountered.  This version may create a more controlled pace with more available hints.
You may choose which to play.

TIPS:
1) The story book for the case is a pdf with CLICKABLE LINKS -- you whould be able to navigate most places from the table of contents or by clicking links.
2) Do note attempt to SEARCH for lead numbers in the story book because you will get results other than the lead you are searching for;
 instead use a pdf tool with support for table of contents (FoxIt reader is free and works well).
3) The Reference Guide contains a large list of resources for doing research; normally you won't be expected to go to one of these places unless it comes up in conversation but you never know.

PROVIDING FEEDBACK:

1) Keep track of any bugs
2) Write down any leads you tried to go to which were not in the book
   (just use the case log and note which leads could not be found)
